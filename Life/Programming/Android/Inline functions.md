Inline functions allow you to pass functions that after that compiles not as anonymous object but passes whole body of that function. It is a lot faster. It's okay when we call this function, but if we need to store it we can not use inline functions because to store function we need object that contains it. We can use inline functions if we know we will call it or pass as parameter to another inline function, otherwise compiler won't allow to use inline function.
