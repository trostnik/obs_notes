If we have primary constructor, each secondary constructor needs to call it through ": this()", which can be either primary constructor itself or another secondary constructor that calls primary constructor. If we don't have primary constructor, but we extend another class, we need to call parent constructor in secondary constructor. If we have primary constructor, than we need to call parent constructor immediately and call primary constructor in each secondary constructors.
