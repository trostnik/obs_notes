By default generic type is invariant, which means that Class<A> is not a subtype of Class<B>, even if A is a subtype of class B. But we can define it to be so if we use Class<out T>. It will limit the use of type argument: we can only "produce" T typed objects, but cannot "consume" them. It is called covariance. To be able to consume them we can use Class<in T>, and we can consider Class<B> to be subtype of Class<A>, if A is a subtype of B
