We have router, navigator, commandBuffer, Screens, NavigationHolder and cicerone. Cicerone contains navigationHolder inside. NavigationHolder is used to store link to Navigator and remove it.Navigator is a class that contains actual logic of screen navigating(with fragmentManager etc.).  Router is placed inside Cicerone class and it can be linked to only one Navigator. Router is a class, that contains high-level functions of navigating and translate calls to Navigator. There are also commands. Commands are Back, Forward, Message, Replace, BackTo. CommandBuffer responsibility is to provide commands from Router to Navigator. To navigate easily we can encapsulate screens into Screen class provided by Cicerone.  Just pass creation of Fragment or Activity intent to object, implementing interface Creator.
